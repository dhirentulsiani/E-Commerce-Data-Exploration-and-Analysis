## About the dataset.

This project analyzes a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce/data) from Brazillian E-Commerce Platform Olist.

The data includes information from a Random Sample of nearly 100 Thousand orders that received a rating/review.

There are 9 tables containing information like: customer location, product descriptions, order data, etc.

Another [dataset](https://sidra.ibge.gov.br/tabela/4714) used was for the population of cities in Brazil.

## About Olist:

Olist connects thousands of smaller sellers/merchants/businesses to over 15 of Brazil's largest  e-marketplaces (Amazon, Americanas, etc.)

Olist does not have its own products. Instead it provides these smaller sellers value by giving them centralized order management, handling shipping and customer service, offering pricing advice, and providing automatic product synchronization across the various marketplaces.

As of the release date of the dataset, Olist did not have access to advertising directly to the end customer.

Their main ways of increasing sales are:

- Increasing the number of sellers who work with olist
- Lowering product prices, delivery costs, and delivery time
- Increasing store reputation across platforms (buybox)

## Objectives:

This analysis will focus on how to improve sales through Olist's existing methods, along with exploring how advertising directly to the end customer can improve sales.

Reports will be made using Power BI to present the findings.
